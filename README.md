1. RandomizedSearchCV and Pipeline for RandomForestRegressor:

  1. Load the housing dataset from the provided GitHub URL.
  2. Split the data into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
  3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  4. Create transformers for numerical and categorical features.
  5. Combine transformers using ColumnTransformer.
  6. Create a pipeline with data preparation and RandomForestRegressor.
  7. Define a parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning.
  8. Use RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
  9. Fit the model on the training data.
  10. Make predictions on the test set.
  11. Evaluate the model using mean squared error on the test set.
    
2. Visualization Codes:

Histogram:
  1. Load the housing dataset.
  2. Plot a histogram of the target variable.

Scatter Plot:
  1. Assuming you have predictions and y_test from the RandomForestRegressor code.
  2. Plot a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values.

 Feature Importance Plot:
  1. Assuming your model is a RandomForestRegressor and has a `feature_importances_` attribute.
  2. Plot a horizontal bar chart of feature importance.

Residual Plot:
  1. Assuming you have predictions and y_test from the RandomForestRegressor code.
  2. Plot a scatter plot of predicted values vs. residuals.

 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Analysis:
  1. Load the housing dataset.
  2. Split the data into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
  3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  4. Standardize the features.
  5. Initialize a KNeighborsRegressor with 5 neighbors.
  6. Fit the model to the training data.
  7. Make predictions on the test set.
  8. Evaluate the model using mean squared error and R-squared score.

4. K-Means Clustering and Visualization:
  1. Load the housing dataset.
  2. Assume the target variable is not included in clustering.
  3. Standardize the features.
  4. Apply K-Means clustering with 3 clusters.
  5. Visualize the clusters in 2D space using PCA for dimensionality reduction.

 5. Heatmap:

  2. Calculate the correlation matrix.
  3. Plot the heatmap using Seaborn to show the correlation between different features.

These code snippets cover data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, visualizations, and clustering analysis on the housing dataset. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific dataset and analysis goals.
